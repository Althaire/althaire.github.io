This year I was lucky enough to be able to attend [DevFest](http://www.devfest.at/) again! Long story short: I haven't been able to find my conference notebook since I came home from RailsCamp Scotland, so I quickly grabbed any notebook I could find on my way out. Turns out this notebook was blank and not lined so I decided to give sketch noting a go! âœ¨

Here are the results:

*Note: The quality of these isn't great at all. I needed them up quickly and never got around to optimising them but I hope you can enjoy!*

<ul class="photo-gallery" style="list-style: none;">
  {% for image in page.images %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ image.link }}">
        <img src="{{ image.image_path }}" alt="{{ image.title}}"/>
      </a>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
